### Functional vs Class Components
So far

| Class                 | Function      |
| -------------         |:-------------:|
| Stateful              | Stateless     |
| Lifecycle events      | X             |
| Complex               | Simple        |

### Functional vs Class Components
And there is...

    <div>
        <img src="./assets/this.gif">
    </div>
    <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### React Hooks introduction
[Motivation:](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
>* Itâ€™s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
>* Complex components become hard to understand
>* Classes confuse both people and machines (this)

### React Hooks introduction
* [Hooks Overview](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
* [State hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
* [Effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
* Live Demo

### Practice Time - warmup
convert class to hooks


---

### Writing Custom Hooks
Exist Hooks
Writing Costume hooks - useInput
Rooks and other hooks

---

### Practice Time
repo
1. Convert components from classes to functions 
2. Adding a feature search with clear - write useDynamicInput

---

### Refactoring with Hooks
1. ~~Convert components from classes to functions~~
2. ~~Adding a feature search with clear - write useDynamicInput~~
3. Make hook reusable - use it in a different component

---

### Pitfalls
* overusing hook - should it be stateful?
* useCallback
