## Module 3
### Functional Components and Hooks
(This document is optimized for presentation using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md))

### Goals
* Understand the motivation behind hooks
* Practice using hooks and custom-hooks
* Hopefully - never writing a Class-component (almost) ever again

---

### Agenda
1. Functional vs Class Components
2. React Hooks introduction
3. More Hooks
3. Writing Custom Hooks
4. Refactoring with Hooks
5. Pitfalls

### Functional vs Class Components
Abilities and Tendencies
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Class Component</th>
        <th>Function Component</th>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Stateful</td><td>Stateless</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lifecycle events</td><td>X</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Complex</td><td>Simple</td></tr>
    <tr><td>?... </td><td>Readable</td></tr>
</table>

### Functional vs Class Components
And there is...
<div>
    <img src="./assets/this.gif">
</div>
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


---

### React Hooks introduction
[Motivation:](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html)
>* Itâ€™s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

>* Complex components become hard to understand
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

>* Classes confuse both people and machines (this) 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### React Hooks introduction
* [Hooks Overview](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html)
* [State hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)
* [Effect hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
* Live Demo

### Practice Time - warmup
convert class to hooks


---

### More Hooks

More Hooks
useContext
useRef
useMemo
useCallback
> React.useMemo will call the function and return its result while React.useCallback will return the function without calling it.

### Writing Custom Hooks
Writing Costume hooks - useInput
Rooks and other hooks

---

### Practice Time
repo
1. Convert components from classes to functions 
2. Adding a feature search with clear - use useDynamicInput

---

### Refactoring with Hooks
1. ~~Convert components from classes to functions~~
2. ~~Adding a feature search with clear - write useDynamicInput~~
3. Make hook reusable - use it in a different component

---

### Pitfalls
* Not following [Rules of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html)
* overusing hook 
    - should it be stateful?
    - do i really need hook for that?
    - is it the right way to do it? (like :useEffect for fetching data)
* not understanding how it works - 
    - on functional component - function is called on each render 
    (the whole component is a render function)
* useEffect forgetting deps 
    - not providing empty array - re-creat on each call)
    - deps does not include all dependencies - useEffect will not update)
    - not understanding useMemo / useCallback
* not using the full power of hooks - reusability
